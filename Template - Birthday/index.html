You are literally my light, in a cruel and difficult world like this, you illuminate my path with your warmth and radiance. No matter how tough life gets, I know you will always be here to light the way and lift my spirit up.

                    <p>I'm always saying in my mind about how amazing the curves on your waist and hips looks anytime you talk about not liking the way your body looks. To me, you are the real defintion of thick beautiful black woman. The gentle curve on your waist, your soft ass, smoothness of your skin is the epitome of attractiveness. A lot of women pay for what you have baby. I just want to let you know that I am in so many ways attracted to you and your body as a whole and I can't wait to have mine against yours </p></div>
